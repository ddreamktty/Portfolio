## üìå About Me 

Hi! I‚Äôm Kittiya Siangprem, a final-year student graduating in May 2025 from the School of Information Technology, KMUTT.  
I'm passionate about Business Analysis, UX/UI Design, and Data Science‚Äîespecially creating digital experiences that meet both user needs and business goals.  
I completed a 6-month internship as a UX/UI Designer at IBOTNOI, where I worked closely with developers and users to design real-world solutions.  
My career goal is to become a BA or UX/UI Designer who can interpret data and insights to drive user-centered, impactful product design.
