### About Me

Hi! I’m Kittiya Siangprem, a final-year student from the School of Information Technology, KMUTT, graduating in May 2025.

I’m passionate about Data Science, Business Analysis, and UX/UI Design, with a focus on creating digital experiences that align with both user needs and business goals.

During my 6-month internship as a UX/UI Designer at IBOTNOI, I collaborated with developers and real users to design practical solutions.  
I believe in data-informed design—using insights to drive intuitive and impactful user experiences.
