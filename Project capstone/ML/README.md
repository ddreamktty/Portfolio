# Capstone Project: Venue Rental Recommendation Platform

**Duration**: August 2024 – June 2025  
**Team**: 3 members  
**My Role**: UX/UI Designer & Machine Learning Developer

## Project Overview

The Venue Rental Recommendation Platform is a web-based solution designed to recommend event venues to users based on their preferences and booking history. The platform aims to simplify the venue booking process by offering personalized venue suggestions using machine learning models trained on user data.

## Machine Learning Development

### ML Model Overview

I led the development of a **recommendation system** using machine learning to suggest venues to users based on their profile data and booking behavior. The system uses data collected during user onboarding (such as age, gender, and interests) and analyzes past booking behavior to make personalized recommendations.

#### Data Collection

- **User Profile**: Collected via onboarding surveys during registration, asking for information such as age, gender, and preferences (e.g., nature, luxury, etc.).
- **Booking Behavior**: Analyzed user booking history to understand their venue choices and identify patterns.

#### Machine Learning Model

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and processed user data for input into the model, ensuring high-quality, relevant features for training.
- **Algorithm**: Developed and trained a custom **ML model** using user preferences and booking data. The model uses **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering** to generate venue suggestions.
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Accuracy: 42.86%
  - Precision: 52.24%
  - Recall: 42.86%
  - F1-score: 41.95%

#### Model Improvement

- Fine-tuned the model by iterating based on user feedback and usability testing, refining recommendations to better align with user expectations.
- Integrated the model with the frontend to provide real-time, personalized venue suggestions on the user's homepage.
