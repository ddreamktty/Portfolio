## Core Features

### 1. Smart Suggestion System (ML-based)

Users answer a short questionnaire during registration about their age, gender, and interests (e.g., nature or luxury). The system uses a machine learning model to recommend venue categories tailored to each user.

- **ML Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 42.8%
  - Precision: 52.24%
  - Recall: 42.86%
  - F1-score: 41.95%

### 2. Event Booking System

Users can search and filter venues based on location, price, or capacity. Each listing includes:
- Full venue details
- Photo gallery
- User reviews
- Easy and fast booking flow

### 3. Integrated Mapping

Users can view venues on a map and see distance from their current location.  
This helps them estimate travel time before booking.
