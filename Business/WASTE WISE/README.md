# WasteWise - Smart Trash Bin System

## Problem
Currently, universities are facing significant challenges in managing food waste. This is due to factors such as ordering more food than necessary, unfinished meals, and improper disposal of waste by students. As a result, food waste ends up in the wrong trash bins, leading to rotting, methane gas emissions, and unpleasant odors. This increases the complexity of waste management processes and negatively impacts both the environment and the university's image.




## Business Aspect

### **Target Market:**
- **University Students**: The main target group, who dispose of waste in various locations within the campus.
- **University Administration and Waste Management Personnel**: Those responsible for managing waste disposal and environmental issues within the university.
- **Energy, Environment, Safety, and Health (EESH)**: The department overseeing environmental and health standards within the university.

### **Root Cause:**
- Lack of motivation to separate waste correctly.
- Absence of proper checks or reminders to dispose of waste correctly.
- Lack of awareness and consciousness about waste segregation, especially food waste, among students.

### **Opportunity / Gap:**
- No system in place to ensure that people understand and properly sort different types of waste.
- Lack of encouragement for students to learn and actively engage in waste segregation.

### **Business Model:**
1. **Revenue Streams**:
   - **Partnership with Universities**: Selling the smart waste management system to universities or related institutions.
   - **Promotional Activities**: Conducting events or competitions promoting waste segregation.
   - **App-based Services**: Offering subscription models or in-app advertising related to waste management.

2. **Impact**:
   - Reducing the amount of food waste disposed of incorrectly.
   - Promoting learning and active participation from students and staff.
   - Supporting the development of sustainable, environmentally friendly solutions.

   - Points can be tracked and displayed in the app, with opportunities to win rewards and compete in eco-friendly challenges.




## Vision
Students and staff at the university will be able to correctly segregate waste according to categories, reducing the amount of food waste being disposed of in the wrong bins and making it possible to repurpose food waste effectively.

### **Goal**
To improve waste segregation in the university, especially food waste, by measuring the amount of correctly sorted food waste disposed of in the correct bins over a two-year period.

### **Theory of Change**
If students become more engaged in waste segregation within the university, especially food waste, and understand how to sort waste properly while collaborating with others in this process, the quality of waste segregation will improve. This can be measured by the statistics of food waste correctly sorted into the right bins over a two-year period.




## Conclusion
WasteWise combines advanced technology with user-centric design to effectively address the issue of food waste segregation in universities. By engaging students and staff, the system promotes sustainable practices and helps create a cleaner, greener campus environment. Additionally, it offers a scalable business model that can be implemented in universities and other organizations looking to manage waste responsibly.
